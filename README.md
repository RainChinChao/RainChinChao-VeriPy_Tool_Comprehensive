# RainChinChao-VeriPy_Tool_Comprehensive



This package contains example environments, demonstration videos, and supporting files for VeriPy, a Python-based high-level synthesis (HLS) tool for automatic Verilog generation.

Directory Overview
1. Environment Files
VeriPy_PipelineEnv.zip and VeriPy_UnrolledEnv.zip
These archives represent two distinct VeriPy environments:

PipelineEnv – for pipelined hardware generation

UnrolledEnv – for fully unrolled hardware generation

Users can download and extract the desired environment based on the hardware type they wish to generate.

2. Demonstration Files
Demon Folder
Contains video demonstrations that guide users through the VeriPy coding workflow, environment setup, and hardware generation process.

3. Example Results
Example Folders
Each folder includes:

Screenshots of hardware generation and synthesis results

The top-level Verilog files generated by VeriPy  

4. Python Source Files
Python Files
Contain the VeriPy-compatible Python implementations of each example.
Please ensure that the files are placed in the correct directory paths as specified in the example scripts to successfully generate the corresponding hardware designs.
